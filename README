TickleText 2.2 README:

TickleText was created by Anthony Baldwin / tonytraductor@linguasos.org

New in this version:
insane journal posting added.

----
DEPENDENCIES:

The recently added LaTeX and pdf functions depend upon enscript, pdflatex,
and latex2html.
Most *nix flavors, to my knowledge, will already have most of those
by default, but, if not, get them here:

Enscript: http://www.codento.com/people/mtr/genscript/
pdflatex: http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/
latex2html: http://www.latex2html.org/

FTP tools require tcl package ftp
(just do teacup install ftp
if you don't already have it.)

The Livejournal posting feature requires package http
Also, it only works if you have a Livejournal.
Get one: http://www.livejourna.com
Mine is http://tonytraductor.livejournal.com

Alternatively, I believe the tcl ft and http are part of tcllib.

tickle text requires:
Tcl-8.5

Get it here:
http://www.activestate.com/store/productdetail.aspx?prdGuid=f0cd6399-fefb-466e-ba17-220dcd6f4078
or
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl/

Ubuntu and Debian users already have tcl8.5 in the apt repos. (apt-get install tcl8.5).
Linguas OS already has tcl8.5 installed by default.
I don't know how many others do.
Some modern Linux OSes are running 8.4 still.
Upgrade.  You'll be glad you did.

----

I no longer recomment tcltext for windows users.
You are free to try, but, I offer you no support.
Your OS sucks.

As far as I know, everyting should work fine on any Linux,
or BSD system, and, likely, OSX.
It all works great here on my Linguas OS box!

Installation for *nix/nux/osx:

For a gui install (requires zenity), cd to the dir where you've downloaded
and extracted the tarball and do 
tar -xf tcltext2.2,tar.gz
su or sudo
./install.sh

For nongui install do
tar -xf tcltext2.2,tar.gz
su or sudo
./nonguiinstall.sh

Enter your username (not root) when the installation asks you for
your name.

This should move all relevant scripts to
/usr/local/bin, and properly change permissions,
as well as create a .tcltext directory in your home (and root's home)
to save configs.  
If you have difficulty, feel free to e-mail me.

Using fluxbox, my menu entry is thus:
[exec] (TickleText) {/usr/local/bin/tcltext} 
Actually, you can even leave off the file path so long
as /usr/local/bin is already in your path, which,
most likely it is.
On gnome or kde, etc., you can make a desktop icon, or whatever you like.
Just point it to the script.
I've even included an icon, now, although, if you're artistic,
perhaps you could make a better one.
Send it to me, if you do!

TickleDict can be run on it's own, once this installation is run, as can the calculator,
and the calendar.
They'll be at 
/usr/local/bin/tdict
/usr/local/bin/tcalcu
/usr/local/bin/ticklecal
respectively.

If you like Tickle Text and want to drop me a line to say thanks,
go ahead and e-mail me at tonytraductor@@linguasos.org
Likewise, do the same if you have any questions about using Tickle Text,
and/or suggestions for new features.
I don't ever intend to implement a million features.
You want something bloated but groOvy and useful, 
get jedit or AlphaTK.
Those are nice.

If you have complaints, call 1-800-YO-MOMS.

Be well,
Tony
