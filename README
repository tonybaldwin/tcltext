DEPENDENCIES:

The recently added LaTeX and pdf functions depend upon enscript, pdflatex,
and latex2html.
Most *nix flavors, to my knowledge, will already have most of those
by default, but, if not, get them here:

Enscript: http://www.codento.com/people/mtr/genscript/
pdflatex: http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex/
latex2html: http://www.latex2html.org/

FTP tools require tcl package ftp
the blog posting features require http

tcl ft and http are part of tcllib.
If you don't have that, for most, it's as simple as
aptitude/yum/apt-get/teacup install tcllib
----

tickle text requires:
Tcl-8.5

Get it here:
http://www.activestate.com/store/productdetail.aspx?prdGuid=f0cd6399-fefb-466e-ba17-220dcd6f4078
or
http://sourceforge.net/projects/tcl/

Ubuntu and Debian users already have tcl8.5 in the apt repos. (apt-get install tcl8.5).
Linguas OS already has tcl8.5 installed by default.
I don't know how many others do.
Some modern Linux OSes are running 8.4 still.
Upgrade.  You'll be glad you did.

----

While tcl is cross-platform and most of tcltext will work on Windows,
I do not recommend tcltext for windows users.
You are free to try, but, I offer you no support.
Your OS sucks. Sorry.

As far as I know, everyting should work fine on any Linux,
or BSD system, and, possibly, OSX.

Installation for *nix/nux/osx:

cd to the dir where you've downloaded
and extracted the tarball and do 
tar -xf tcltext2.3.tar.gz
su or sudo
./install.sh

Enter your username (not root) when the installation asks you for
your name.

This should move all relevant scripts to
/usr/local/bin, and properly change permissions,
as well as create a .tcltext directory in your home (and root's home)
to save configs.  
If you have difficulty, feel free to e-mail me.

TDict can be run on it's own, once this installation is run, as can the calculator,
and the calendar.
They'll be at 
/usr/local/bin/tdict
/usr/local/bin/tcalcu
/usr/local/bin/ticklecal
respectively.

----
If you like TclText and want to drop me a line to say thanks,
go ahead and e-mail me at tony@tonybaldwin.org
Likewise, do the same if you have any questions about using TclText,
and/or suggestions for new features.
I don't ever intend to implement a million features.
You want something bloated but groOvy and useful, 
get jedit or emacs.
Those are nice.

If you have complaints, call 1-800-YO-MOMS.

Be well,
Tony
